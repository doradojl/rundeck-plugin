This directory will default to a subirectory called "build" and created in the current working directory.

It will contain generated code and the archived plugin Zip you can copy to the Rundeck plugins directory (eg, $RDECK_BASE/libext).

After the build is complete (and the plugin Zip is obtained) it is safe to remove this directory.
